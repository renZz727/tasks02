          Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form,
          harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content.[1][2][3]
          Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present
          in all human societies.[4] Definitions of music vary widely in
          substance and approach.[5] While scholars agree that music is defined
          by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to
          what these necessary elements are.[6] Music is often characterized as
          a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity.[7] Diverse
          activities are involved in the creation of music, and are often
          divided into categories of composition, improvisation, and
          performance.[8] Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical
          instruments, including the human voice. It can also be composed,
          sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically
          or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital
          audio workstation software on a computer. Music often plays a key role
          in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making
          music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is
          played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as
          festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music
          is used in the production of other media, such as in soundtracks to
          films, TV shows, operas, and video games. Listening to music is a
          common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends
          into areas of academic study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and
          therapy. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound
          engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments,
          accessories, and publishers of sheet music and recordings. Technology
          facilitating the recording and reproduction of music has historically
          included sheet music, microphones, phonographs, and tape machines,
          with playback of digital music being a common use for MP3 players, CD
          players, and smartphones.

        <h2>Etymology and terminology</h2>
        <p>
          The modern English word music came into use in the 1630s.[9] It
          descends from Middle English musike, which in turn descends from Old
          French musique, then Latin mūsica[10][7][n 1]—and ultimately from
          Ancient Greek mousiké technē (μουσική τέχνη), a phrase meaning "art of
          the Muses".[10][n 2] The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek
          mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.[13][14] They were
          included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and
          Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music
          specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more
          prominently than the other muses.[11] The Latin word musica was also
          the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via
          spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were
          probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch
          muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.[14]
